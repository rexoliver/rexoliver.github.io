# Rex Oliver's Personal Website!

This is the source code for my personal website, built using TypeScript and React, and hosted on GitHub Pages. You can view the website live at [https://rexoliver.com](https://rexoliver.com).

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the dependencies:
 
```
git clone https://github.com/rexoliver/rexoliver.github.io.git
cd rexoliver.github.io
npm install
```
To start a local development server, run the following commands:

```
npm start
```

This will start a development server and open the website in your default browser. Any changes you make to the code will automatically update the website in real-time.

## Deployment

To deploy the website to GitHub Pages, run this command:

```
npm run deploy
```

This will build the website and push it to the master branch of your GitHub repository. The website will be live at https://rexoliver.com.

## Customization

To customize the website for your own use, you can edit the files in the src directory. Here's a brief overview of the files and directories:

- src/components: This directory contains React components for the various sections of the website, such as the header, about section, and projects section.
- src/data: This directory contains JSON files with data for the various sections of the website, such as your personal information and a list of your projects.
- src/App.tsx: This is the main entry point for the website, which imports and renders the various components.
- src/index.tsx: This is the entry point for the React application, which renders the App component.

You can edit these files to customize the website with your own content and styling.
